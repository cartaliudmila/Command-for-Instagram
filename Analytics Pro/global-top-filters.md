We analyzed data on thousands of Instagram accounts to build this feature. It lets you see the top filters in over 60 different countries and 110 different timezones. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and let's be honest, not everybody is an Instagram visionary. You prefer to use Instagram filters rather than complex photo editing software because, well, it's just easier. You've been using the [filter analytic](https://github.com/shakked/Command-for-Instagram/blob/master/Analytics%20Pro.md#top-hashtags-and-filters) to optimize your posts for your current audience, but you know that a lot of your followers are from European countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Aren't you curious what filters those countries like the most? With the Global Top Filters, you can view the data we've gather on these countries. You can see which filters tend to get the highest number of likes in each of those countries. Using this information, you can optimize your posts and get more overall likes and comments.
