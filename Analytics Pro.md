##Searching
[Searching Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=21m50s)

The searching feature lets you look up public Instagram accounts and see analytics on their posts. In the past, it was possible to see private accounts and information about their followers as well. On June 1st, 2016, Instagram revised their API so this is no longer possible. However, the searching feature still provides great functionality:
* View all of the following information about a user's posts:
  * When to Post (the user's personalized best time to post)
  * Graphs of their posts over time (Likes/Comments per day, week, month, year)
  * Most Popular Posts
  * Most Liked Posts
  * Most Commented Posts
  * Most Embarrassing Posts (Least likes and comments)
  * Least Liked Posts
  * Least Commented Posts
  * Top Hashtags (Which hashtags get this user the highest number of likes/comments)
  * Top Filters (Which filters get this user the highest number of likes/comments)
  * Best Weeks (posts organized into weekly blocks with like/comment totals, like/comment averages)
  * Best Months (posts organized into monthly blocks with like/comment totals, like/comment averages)
  * Best Years (posts organized into yearly blocks with like/comment totals, like/comment averages)
* View people who liked and commented on this user's photos
  * You can follow and unfollow here
* View all of the following information about a user's engagement
  * Best Followers
  * Top Likers
  * Top Comments
  * Speechless Likers (people who liked but didn't comment on the user's photos)

##Top Hashtags and Filters
[Top Hashtags and Filters Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=4m5s)

This feature lets you see which filters and hashtags are getting you the most likes and comments. That a business cannot see their hashtag or filter performance within Instagram is troubling. That's why I created this feature--so businesses could see how their hashtags and filters are doing over time.

##Following Tracker
[Following Tracker Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=11m59s)

Track who you follow and unfollow. This is also usefule to detect when people have deleted their accounts. If you follow a user and they delete their account, the user will be appear in the Following Tracker as someone you unfollowed.

##Ghost Followers
[Ghost Followers Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=10m45s)

See followers who haven't engaged with any of your photos. If you want to assess how active your followers are, this is a great tool for that. For smaller, up and coming accounts, this can be insightful.

##Secret Admirers
[Secret Admirers Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=11m18s)

See users who have engaged with your photos but haven't followed you. This feature is a great help to users looking to grow their accounts. Follow them, reach out to them, message them and they might become followers.

##Global Best Time to Post
[Global Best Time to Post Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=14m2s)

We analyzed data on thousands of Instagram accounts to build this feature. It lets you see the best time to post in over 60 different countries and 110 different timezones. If your page has an international audience, it is useful to know the best times to post in different countries and timezones. Consider the following scenario: you have a substantial audience in Japan, but you are based out of Los Angeles. You found out that Americans are most active on Wednesdays/Thursdays at 4:00pm in the afternoon, but you want to target your Japanese audience this time. Using the global best time feature, you can see that the Japanese are most active on Instagram on Saturdays at 12:00pm local time. Then, you do the time conversion, see that 12:00pm Japanese time is 11:00pm Los Angeles time. Now, you've optimized your post for your Japanese audience.

##Global Top Filters
[Global Top Filters Screencast](https://youtu.be/4yp_YWUqtPU?t=16m22s)

We analyzed data on thousands of Instagram accounts to build this feature. It lets you see the top filters in over 60 different countries and 110 different timezones. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and let's be honest, not everybody is an Instagram visionary. You prefer to use Instagram filters rather than complex photo editing software because, well, it's just easier. You've been using the [filter analytic](https://github.com/shakked/Command-for-Instagram/blob/master/Analytics%20Pro.md#top-hashtags-and-filters) to optimize your posts for your current audience, but you know that a lot of your followers are from European countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Aren't you curious what filters those countries like the most? With the Global Top Filters, you can view the data we've gather on these countries. You can see which filters tend to get the highest number of likes in each of those countries. Using this information, you can optimize your posts and get more overall likes and comments. 

##Global Top Hashtags

Track up to 50 accounts with this feature. Not only can you track your own accounts, you can track any public account. See hourly stats on the following:
* Followers - total number of followers
* Change in Followers - how many followers you are gaining/losing every hour
* Followings - total number of followings
* Change in Followings - how many followings you are gaining/losing every houry
* Posts - total number of posts every hour

* Change in Likes - how mnay likes you are gaining/losing every hour
* Comments - how many comments you have on your last 99 posts
* Change in Comments - how many comments you are gaining/losing every hour

Also, you can export any of the above data sets to .csv files that you can analyze in excel. All of the above data are displayed on interactive charts. You can change the units of the graph to be Days, Weeks, or Months. For example, instead seeing how many followers you are gaining/losing every hour, you can see how many you are gaining every day, week, or month.

#Captions
The captions module is designed for power users. Often times, businesses and influential accounts like to have a standardized format for their captions. They might add a series of hashtags at the end or they might include some important information about their product. In order to save time, these people often use tools like Evernote or Apple's Notes. The Captions module is an even better option. It was designed with efficiency in mind. Their is a 'Copy' button and an 'Open Instagram' button to speed up your workflow. There also various presets that can be used to design good looking captions. Lastly, we have a database of 100s of quotes to help spice up your captions.
